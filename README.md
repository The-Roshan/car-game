# Car Game

## Overview
The Car Game is an engaging, browser-based game created by Roshan Kumar Prajapati. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, it challenges players to navigate a car using arrow keys to avoid collisions with other cars. The game features a dynamic game area, real-time score tracking, a high score display, and a start screen with instructions. It is designed to provide a fun and interactive experience, optimized performance for desktop devices.

## Features
- **Game Interface**:
  - **Start Screen**: Displays instructions (use arrow keys to move, avoid collisions) and a clickable prompt to begin the game.
  - **Game Area**: Shows the player's car controlled by the player and opponent cars to avoid.
  - **Score Display**: Real-time score and high score tracking displayed at the top.
- **Controls**: Arrow keys for smooth car movement.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**:
  - Players move their car to avoid collisions with opponent cars.
  - Game ends on collision, with the final score recorded.
  - High score persists across sessions (requires local storage implementation).
- **Visual Design**:
  - Styled with a custom font (Lobster) from Google Fonts for a playful aesthetic.
  - Custom CSS for the game area, car, and UI elements (`styles.css`).
- **Dependencies**:
  - jQuery (version 3.6.0 via CDN) for DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **Responsive Design**: Primarily designed for desktop, with potential for mobile adaptation via CSS media queries.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Structure of the game interface, including start screen, score displays, and game area.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the game elements, layout, and animations (`styles.css`).
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including car movement, collision detection, and score tracking (`game.js`).
- **jQuery**: Simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling (via CDN).
- **Google Fonts**: Lobster font for typography.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code) for customization.
- Internet connection for loading jQuery and Google Fonts from CDNs (or download locally for offline use).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Roshan/car-game.git
cd car-game
```

### 2. Open the Website
- Open `index.html` in a web browser:
  ```bash
  open index.html  # macOS
  start index.html  # Windows
  ```
- Alternatively, use a local development server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) for better performance.

### 3. Customize (Optional)
- Edit `styles.css` to modify colors, car designs, or animations.
- Update `game.js` to enhance gameplay (e.g., add power-ups, levels, or sound effects).
- Modify `index.html` to add new UI elements or adjust instructions.

## Usage
1. **Start the Game**: Click the start screen to begin.
2. **Controls**: Use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the car.
3. **Objective**: Avoid colliding with other cars to increase your score.
4. **Game Over**: The game ends on collision, displaying your final score and updating the high score if applicable.
5. **Score Tracking**: View real-time score and high score at the top of the game area.

## Deployment
- **Static Hosting**:
  1. Upload `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `game.js` to a hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
  2. Configure the service to serve `index.html` as the entry point.
- **GitHub Pages Example**:
  1. Push the repository to GitHub.
  2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings, selecting the `main` branch.
  3. Access the site at `https://the-roshan.github.io/car-game`.
- **Netlify Example**:
  1. Drag the project folder into Netlify’s dashboard.
  2. Deploy and use the provided URL.
- **Local Server**:
  ```bash
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```
  Visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Notes
- **jQuery Dependency**: The game uses jQuery via CDN (`https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js`). For offline use, download the library and host it locally.
- **JavaScript Logic**: The `game.js` file must implement game mechanics, including car movement, collision detection, score updates, and high score storage (e.g., using `localStorage`).
- **Styling**: The `styles.css` file should define the game area, car sprites, score display, and start screen visuals.
- **Enhancements**: Consider adding sound effects, multiple levels, or mobile touch controls for improved gameplay.
- **SEO**: Update meta tags in `<head>` (e.g., `description`, `keywords`) for better visibility.
- **License**: Include the MIT License in `LICENSE.md` to clarify usage terms (as provided previously).
